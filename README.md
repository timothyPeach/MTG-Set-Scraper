# MTG-Set-Scraper

Hey there!  

This is the an early version of an MtG set Webscraper / to-DataFrame / to-csv conversion.  It currently can get a lot of information on different Magic the Gathering sets and distill it into a .csv file.  There was a need for regex in the scraping of the actual text that's on the cards, but mostly this was easy and only required string splitting.  I'll need to look for a harder site to really showcase webscraping and data engineering, but this is what I have for now.

But yeah with this you can pretty quickly download and save an entire set and all the information about all the rare and mythic cards.  I have not included uncommons and commons yet, because in the beginning, I intended for this to be about estimating booster box value for different MtG sets, rather than just collecting info on all the cards, and it's really the rares and mythics that have basically all the value in sets.

Anyhow yeah, check it out!  Webscraping / Data engineering repo!
