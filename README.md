# MTG-Set-Scraper-and-Booster-Box-Value-Estimator

Hey there!  

This is the first version of my webscraper / value estimator for Magic the Gathering (MtG) booster boxes in different card sets!

In MtG, there are several different sets with different names like "Hour of Devastation", "Eldritch Moon", and "Ixalan":

All of these have lots of cool cards in their booster boxes and stuff, but how much are they worth on average?
How much are the cards selling for right now?

Rather than taking what must be at least an hour to manually go on gatherer.wizards.com and get all the names of
Rare and Mythic cards and go to mtggoldfish.com and enter them all in the search bar and make sure you specify the correct set
(what a headache!) these functions allow you to scrape an entire set in half a minute and estimate
the value of a booster box just by entering the set name and how many mythic rares appear in a box on average.

I'll be updating this here and there so that it has additional useful functionality.

Happy estimating!

EDIT:  Currently I do not have exceptions that handle sets like Amonkhet, Hour of Devastation, Kaladesh, Aether Revolt, and other sets which all contain very very rare "Masterpiece" cards which have to be factored in to the average value, and so for those, the value estimation is currently inaccurate.
