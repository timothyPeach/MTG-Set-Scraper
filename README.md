# MTG-Set-Scraper-and-Booster-Box-Value-Estimator

Hey there!  

This is the first version of my webscraper / value estimator for Magic the Gathering (MtG) booster boxes in different card sets!

In MtG, there are several different sets with different names like "Hour of Devastation", "Eldritch Moon", and "Ixalan":

All of these have lots of cool cards in them and stuff, but how much are they worth on average?  How much are those cards
selling for right now?

Rather than taking what must be at least an hour, these functions allow you to scrape an entire set in half a minute and estimate
the value of a booster box just by entering the set name and how many mythic rares appear in a box on average.

I'll be updating this here and there so that it has additional useful functionality.

Happy estimating!
